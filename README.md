## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Jr. Data Scientist and AI Researcher
MITU Skillologies — 2023 to 2025

- Led R&D for 3+ end-to-end Generative AI and MLOps proof-of-concept projects and guided technical teams through design, implementation, and deployment.
- Designed and deployed production-ready RAG pipelines using LangChain and ChromaDB with modern embeddings for semantic search and retrieval.
- Built curricula and authored courses covering Advanced Python, Data Analysis, MLOps, and Generative AI; trained and upskilled 2000+ engineers and professionals.
- Mentored teams in applying frameworks such as LangChain, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to real-world problems and ensured best practices for reproducibility and deployment.

## PROJECTS

**Conversational Legal Agent (RAG)**
- [Live Demo](https://lagent.adityathakare.app)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/AdityaThakare72/Legal_Agent1)
- Built an end-to-end conversational RAG agent for Indian law: web scraping, data processing and chunking, vector store (ChromaDB), embeddings, and LangChain orchestration. Deployed as a secure web app on DigitalOcean (Streamlit + Nginx).

**AI Research Crew (Agentic AI)**
- Designed an autonomous multi-agent crew using CrewAI for content research, writing, and critique. Implemented workflow orchestration for automated technical content creation.

**Deployed Salary Predictor (MLOps)**
- Developed a salary prediction model (Scikit-learn), created a FastAPI REST service, containerized with Docker, and implemented CI/CD with GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
